  <p class="note">
The test matrices are generated by sending the payload in each example
(without the `proof` value) to an issuer and then a verifier. To generate
the interoperability matrix, all issuers are tested against all verifiers.
At present, all issuers and verifiers use the Ed25519 2020 cryptosuite.
In order to demonstrate some of the compression features of CBOR-LD QR Codes,
the Ed25519 2020 cryptosuite is used. The QR Code contains a base-32
alphanumeric encoded CBOR-LD payload that is digitally signed using the
Ed25519 2020 cryptosuite, which allows for better compression when used with
CBOR-LD. The payloads displayed in this report, and the ones used with issuers
and verifiers are different at present. The payloads used with issuers and
verifiers will be updated to the payloads described in this report when
support for these newer payloads are supported by all issuers and verifiers.
Readers should take note that the interoperability demonstrated in the matrices
are for the 2020 Ed25519 cryptosuite, and not the 2020 Ed25519 cryptosuite.

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The purpose of this document is to demonstrate that there are multiple Issuers and Verifiers
capable of processing Verifiable Driver's License Credentials that conform to the <a href="https://github.com/digitalbazaar/vdl-vocab">Verifiable Driver's License Vocabulary</a>.</p>
  <section class="informative" id="testing-methodolgy">
    <h3> Testing Methodology</h3>
    <p>The testing framework for the Verifiable Driver's License Vocab executes the following process:</p>
    <ol class="algorithm">
      <li>Takes Verifiable Driver's License Credentials produced from existing ISO standards</li>
      <li>Passes these Verifiable Driver's License Credentials to numerous Issuers</li>
      <li>Asserts that the issuer has issued a valid Verifiable Credential</li>
      <li>Passes the Verifiable Driver's License Credential to numerous Verifiers</li>
      <li>Collates the results in an interoperability matrix</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Key</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>✓ - Success</li>
      <li>❌ - Error</li>
